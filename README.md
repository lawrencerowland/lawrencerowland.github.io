# This website introduces the various repositories

The website is published [here](https://lawrencerowland.github.io): it has been written as a guide to getting started with deploying these portfolio management capabilities for another team's portfolio.  

Or the code and document repositories are available from [my main Github page](https://github.com/lawrencerowland)

## Local development

This site is a standard Jekyll project. To run it locally you need a working Ruby
environment with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed. Once Ruby and
Bundler are available, install the dependencies and serve the site with:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The website will then be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

The interactive examples under [`examples/`](examples/) are regular HTML files
and can also be opened directly in a browser if you prefer to run them outside
of Jekyll.
