## Applying machine learning at project or programme or portfolio levels

Machine learning provides different types of insight at different project levels. 

1. PROJECT & PROGRAMME level: node, edge and property prediction for risks, dependencies, project sectoral properties and success.

1. PORTFOLIO level: mostly standard network algorithms (centrality, breadth first search etc). Includes the conversion between graph and tree structures to provide appropriate views for different stakeholders. The ML element is currently restricted to identifying common and anomalous graph motifs.

1. TASK AND SCHEDULE level: This is the least well developed, but a broad range of approaches to making the most of the Optimisation work of Professor Warren B. Powell, making the most of the inherent graph structure of resource-task-outcome paths. 
Eventually exploring Graph-Graph neural networks & Seq-Seq/ Transformer approaches as well as Monte Carlo Tree search

1. PMO and CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE. NLP applied to boost taxonomic and semantic approaches to curating body of project practice for the orgranisation. 

## Applying machine learning on top of graph databases
Some machine learning approaches make the most of the extra context provided by graph databases, specifically in terms of which relationships are meaningful.
