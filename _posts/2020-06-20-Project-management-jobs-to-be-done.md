# What are the jobs being done ?

Clayton Christensen would always ask, when it came to a service or a product, what is the that is actually being done. 

1. What information do I need to collect about our projects, so that I can answer any reasonable question from the Board, now or in the future ?

1. How can I see likely dependencies with the rest of the business, even those that are not baked into the schedule?

1. What are the actual project management tasks that need to be done for this business, in this sector, on behalf of this Board?

1. Which current projects are most likely to fail, based on our record.
