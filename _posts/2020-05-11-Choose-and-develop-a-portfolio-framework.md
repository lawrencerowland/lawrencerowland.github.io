# Choose and develop a portfolio framework

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Purpose
- Provide a starting point for a usable portfolio framework with deployable working practices
-Provide the knowledge tools to adapt any portfolio framework for a particular business area.

## MOTIVATION
It is helpful to have a practice framework for project portfolio management that meets the needs of the organisation. This sets out how the portfolio is managed. There are several excellent standard frameworks to begin from (Praxis, Axelos MoP etc) but they are often quite general. It is recommended that your preferred framework is adapted to:

1. reflect how the portfolio is currently managed in reality
2. goes into more detail on working practices
3. is tailored to suit the particular business domain
4. is regularly updated as lessons are learned.


## Code and library base
If you wish to go straight to the code and document libraries, start [here](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks)

## Use cases
1. Set-up for a framework for a particular sector/company.
1. Extract and modify from existing frameworks.
1. Apply Natural Language Processing to your current project documents to find the structure of your particular business domain.


## Other Alternative frameworks
I tend to use whatever will be understood by my colleagues, or whatever has worked in the past in the same organisation. Going beyond the work on this site, other recommended starting points are:
-[Praxis](https://www.praxisframework.org) P3M Open source comprehensive and thoughtful framework 
-[Axelos](htpps://axelos.com) Proprietary frameworks MoP, MSP and Prince. Managing Successful Programmes MSP Axelos because it clearly distinguishes programmes from projects, and it is clear about how to integrate with Business as usual via Business Change Managers or similar. Going this route, I would use PRINCE for the projects. Axelos P3M3 maturity framework for projects and programmes so that only programme process that will be understood will be used.
-APM BOK and PMBOK are bodies of knowledge which are worth using for particular project types, especially regulatory or technical projects. 
-[EU PM2 and Open PM2](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ac3e118a-cb6e-11e8-9424-01aa75ed71a1) is a straightforward framework used widely in the EU, useful for collaboration, mostly at project level.
-For agile projects I would use whatever framework project members are most comfortable with. SCRUM or KANBAN is straightforward. I use -Cynefin (https://cognitive-edge.com) sometimes for high consequence environments for organisational sense making.
