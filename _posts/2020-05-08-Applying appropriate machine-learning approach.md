# Applying appropriate machine-learning approach.

Once a project-management use case has been selected [see here](https://lawrencerowland.github.io/ML-for-portfolios.html), then the following steps can be applied to apply the approach to the projects.

# Selection of machine-learning method 
Use cases will be better suited to one type of ML method or another.

# Selection of machine-learning model
To apply this type of ML method, one may wish to use one of the following specific model types as a first pass.

Type of ML model suitable per Project Use Case. 
***Models that are classical rather than machine learning in brackets***
  
# Selection of model environment
Here are some accessible environments where one can apply these types of ML methods.

# Selection of machine-learning code library
Here are some examples of libraries where these models can be found in a convenient format

# Selection of suitable data-sets for each Use Case
For example, these data-sets could be selected.

# Summary 
Machine learning boosts most stages of the project lifecycle, from Project definition to close-out.

This has illustrated some routes to first application of machine learning models with one's own portfolio data. 

1. Identify possible use cases
1. Map  to business area/lifecycle
1. Narrow down to a generic ML method
1. Select a straightforward ML model
1. Choose a suitable model environment
1. Choose a code library or algorithm to apply that model
1. Select data-set

This gives something to play with, and get something to work. There are plenty of ML prototyping frameworks available to provide structure for developing a prototype.
