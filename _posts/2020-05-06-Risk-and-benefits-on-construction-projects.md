***Managing Risk on a large construction project***

§ ***1 The first three activities in our risk management plan.***

***the risk team must proactively focus on 3 parallel activities:***

1.  ***To undertake immediate assessment and proactively drive mitigation activities for any high-rated risks***

2.  ***To test, review and refresh the current risk baseline***

3.  ***To understand the project’s sensitivity to key threats***

***1. Immediate assessment and proactive mitigation must be carried out if the programme is to stay on track. We suggest two likely areas of risk which will require immediate review (a) risk to demand, (b) risk from adjacent transport projects***

1)  ***demand risk:new surveys must be commissioned immediately. We recommend that these should focus on two areas: actual flows in the area, and stated preference surveys of travellers in the area.***

2)  ***Risk from adjacent transport projects: The dependencies between projects are complex within a city travel matrix, and we would need to understand how much work has been done to map out exactly when and where other transport projects will open new routes, or temporarily close existing routes, in the area of the proposed project. Passenger demand behaves elastically to faster times in the urban environment, and if an adjacent transport scheme is planned, which will add or subtract even ten minutes from a typical journey around the area of the proposed new project, then the anticipated benefits may well not materialise at all. The immediate action is to review the risk identification and project dependency tracking which has been carried out so far, and if this work is not well developed, to draw up an outline time-chainage/location graph of current and future schemes, as a precursor to establishing a plan to manage these dependencies, and identify any immediate negotiations required.***

***In this instance then, We would recommend two specific risk mitigations: to commission new travel surveys, and to draw up a time-chainage/location of all adjacent projects.***

***2. Prepare a risk baseline. It is important when coming into a project to check and refresh the overall assessment of risk exposure. In the case of this project, it is additionally important for confirming that no extra approvals need to be sought. This is because the project is currently valued at £20m, which is close to the £25m cap on what the Finance MD can approve alone.This £5m gap is not a large one: it would be easy for the costs to increase as feasibility and design continues, and for the project to newly require higher level sign off. A reclassification of the project approval levels would be likely to delay the schedule. Therefore, checking the risks to scope and cost by preparing a baseline will be valuable in checking the level of confidence we have in the £20m figure.***

  - ***The risk identification will be checked for coverage (is it biased into certain areas?), for currency (how recently it has been reviewed/ updated?), and for balance (are opportunities identified as well as risks?).***

  - ***Levels of risk analysis will be checked, to ensure that risk estimation has been carried out upon consistent principles, and that the results look sensible and proportional to the scheme.***

***This task will be done in conjunction with a review of Benefit/Cost ratios and value for money, as risks are ultimately a risk to the final balance of benefits achieved against costs. The benefit cost ratio here is tight, and reliant as it is on a cyclist’s value of time, the ratio would be very sensitive to any changes in demand.***

***Once a baseline is assured, it will be kept under close and regular review, as per the emerging risk plan. (Note that the baseline will commence immediately, even as a full risk management strategy and risk management plan are prepared in parallel).***

***3. Initial sensitivity analysis: The risk baselining activity (above) is essentially a bottom-up exercise, which is why We also propose looking top-down at the types of risks typically incurred on this kind of project. This can be carried out through an initial sensitivity exercise, marking both benefit and cost components against their tolerance for movements in key elements of scope, so that we can frame the risk management plan against the main types of threat, and open to upside opportunities. For instance, it may be determined that many benefits are very dependent on the scheduled completion date, so we would look for early ways of underwriting the schedule.***

***This sensitivity analysis will take into account appropriate historical Owner /city projects as benchmarks. By looking at projected and outturn costs and patronage, the key risks and sensitivities can be tested.***

§ ***2. Responding to conflict in objectives with a City area, with risk implications***

***There are several different types of conflict that could have arisen regarding the objectives of this project. Understanding the context in which any conflict has arisen is essential, in order to act without risk of worsening the situation. The conflict could:***

  - ***Be a straightforward delay in agreeing the objectives which causes a schedule impact to setting the terms of the architecture competition***

  - ***Reflect the intrinsic complexity of the stakeholder picture, such that the negotiation of a final set of objectives involves unavoidable difficulties. In this event, resolving the immediate dispute is not enough. There would also be a need to unpick the complex matrix of stakeholder interests, and be careful not to further complicate a future design by agreeing incoherent modified objectives in haste***

  - ***Arise from a fundamental problem or inconsistency within the current list of objectives, and the Borough may be pointing out real and systemic risks inherent within the current scope. In this case, again, resolving the dispute is not enough. It should be considered whether systemic risks have crept into our current scope and objectives, and ensure it cannot happen again.***

***And in general, we would tackle any such dispute at several levels at once:***

  - ***Risk identification: Conduct an exercise to identify and evaluate the various consequences/risks which are possible if the dispute continues***

  - ***Risk mitigation: Prepare mitigations for the likely risks, and closely monitor the situation***

  - ***Reporting: Communicate this as an issue at the next Steering Group meeting, and escalate it as requiring their resolution if required***

  - ***Stakeholder engagement: we would increase our activities in working and communicating with the Borough, to address and understand how the two parties can work better together. This activity would aim to facilitate agreement among both parties, and mitigate the risk of poor communication resulting in more serious issues to the project in later phases.***

  - ***User requirement and benefits mapping review: we would use this as an opportunity to jointly review how the user objectives agreed so far map through to the current scope and the benefits profile. By testing these links into benefits, potentially even running the alternate objectives as two separate scenarios, the implications of particular objectives may become clearer to both parties, and a trade-off decision can be successfully agreed. Even if this is not the final outcome, the project team will have successfully refreshed their benefits map.***

§ ***3 Steps to integrate with ongoing risk management***

***We would (a) agree a risk policy, and (b) write a risk management strategy, both of which are compliant with Owner’s corporate risk management solution, and c) take steps to embed lessons learned at each phase of the project;***

1)  **A*greeing a risk policy suitable for the project***

***In consultation with Owner’s corporate risk management solution, We’s proposed risk policy would comprise the key principles that would be agreed with Owner and the Development Partnership. Notably:***

***The policy would set out what risk and value means in the context of the Project. The term risk would include anything which:***

  - ***compromises the building of the preferred option for the Project to the agreed quality, schedule & cost***

<!-- end list -->

  - ***compromises the realisation of the agreed benefits***

  - ***could cause damage, liability, or reputational harm to Owner itself , its delivery partners, and the neighbourhood***

  - ***Arises at all levels within the project.***

***The policy would detail the importance for actively seeking and analysing new opportunities to create value to all parties on the project, which will offset some of the risks to the project that cannot be mitigated.***

***The Policy would describe which parties within the Partnership are responsible for managing special types of risk, how the parties require the programme to appraise them of the ongoing risk picture and what levels of recourse the Partners have to remedy unacceptable risk. Our policy would be congruent with the project’s policy on safety risk (in design and operation).***

***(b) Preparing a risk management strategy and plan.***

***We’s approach is to ensure that all of the functions of risk are carried out, not just those of identification, assessment and reporting. Risk management is a call to actio***![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image2.png)***n, and above all, it sets out the need and scope of the next leadership decisions. The table shows the key functions of risk that need to be carried out. To do this, we have distinguished between levels of risk, and areas of responsibility. High impact risks must be treated differently from low risk ones, and a risk manager must be guided by their senses of proportion and timeliness and not only from a sense of responsibility. The table also shows how we would link with Owner’s risk systems: for instance, making the most of heat tables, risk drawdown, Primavera & ARM, P50 risk levels, and working with the Key Risk Representative.***

***Table*** ***2: Risk Strategy: How the key functions of risk will be carried out on the Project***

![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image3.png)

***(c) Embed Lessons learned at all levels of the programme***

***At the point where we identify the risk from the borough interaction with Owner (see above), we would review both the Owner risk database and lessons learned database to see if similar stakeholder issues have occurred. It is likely that time and money will be saved from adopting previously hard won lessons. Upwards, we would integrate with the Owner PMO’s system to make best use of the good risk mitigation strategies Owner already has. These include the use of 5\*5 heat maps, and the quarterly corporate risk acceptability/ tolerance sessions which are held at the corporate level. In terms of managing contractors, we would encourage BS11000 Collaboration protocols, which include the sharing of appropriate lessons learned across the supply chain.***




<span class="underline">1 Benefits management at the  portfolio, Programme, and project level.</span>

**Approach:** Benefits management is critical because without careful consideration Programmes often deliver scope but don’t realise actual benefits**.** *We will implement a benefits management approach and plan that accommodates Owner’s process readiness, existing levels of benefits and programme management maturity and – importantly – change readiness at both the stated portfolio and programme level.*

We’s benefit approach supports **the delivery of benefits in four stages:**

1.  **Identify the benefits at the portfolio and programme level**

2.  **Mapping expected benefits to scope**

3.  **Controlling the delivery of expected benefits** via oversight of portfolio and programme delivery

4.  **Realising the benefits in close working with the business and stakeholder groups**



1\. **Identifying the benefits** is carried out as part of the portfolio investment cycle or programme start up and benefits are captured within the programme business case. The business case is often based on the HM Treasury 5 case approach and has a strategic section that sets out the benefit gained for the investment required in the programme. All of the strategic outcomes intended for the programme will be in some way closely linked to reaching particular benefit(s), or to minimising particular dis-benefits. Activities include:

  - Agree clear benefits management roles and responsibilities and governance of benefits management

  - Identify the functions and stakeholders involved, gather information. Understand and agree required outcomes and Identify strategic drivers 

  - Identify, define and agree benefits - document the benefits in the business case

  - Apply lessons learned from previous projects

2\. **Mapping** **Benefits to Scope.** To ensure that benefits claimed are achievable, each programme in the portfolio is reviewed to ensure that the scope of their tranches of projects will aggregate to the benefit desired. Scope is reviewed to ensure that it is both necessary and sufficient, typically We would use a benefits dependency network tool to do this. Activities include:

  - Identify and model enablers and benefits critical to the realisation process

  - Assess the enablers, benefits / negative benefits and outcomes (end benefits) and their linkages

  - Agree how benefits will be quantified and measured (KPIs)

  - Define measurement techniques to be used for expected benefits

*3**. Controlling the delivery of expected benefits** via oversight of portfolio and programme delivery. This is completed by maintaining oversight of programme and project delivery and tracing the benefits through the dependency maps prepared in Stage 2 above. Without mapping it is often all too easy to potentially cut the scope of projects to permit delivery timescales yet find out later that key benefits are now unachievable. New benefits should be identified where possible, particularly where previously planned benefits are at risk of being compromised. Activities include:*

  - Develop benefits tracking and reporting

  - Manage benefits realisation, conduct regular benefits review to capture progress both in terms of realising those benefits planned for and identification of new ones

  - Update business case on an ongoing basis

  - Use a scope management methodology to check benefits if scope changes and provide change control for benefits

***4. Realising benefits** is focused on linking between the final commissioning teams, the line operational staff who will run it after handover and the stakeholder groups that will use the new capability. Planning for the realisation of benefits starts early in the programme, and it will be delivered by following a pre-agreed benefit realisation plan for each benefit (or collection of benefits), where project members, operational staff and user stakeholder groups are co-signees of a benefit profile and are jointly accountable for realising a particular benefit. Activities include:*

  - Manage and track benefits realisation for actual benefits

  - Define any required business change approach required to support benefits realisation

  - Regular benefits management reviews for actual benefits delivery, report progress

  - Develop Owner capabilities in benefits management (for testing and commissioning teams and operational line managers)

*Any changes in current ways of working or Owner processes that are required, in order to support the benefits realisation / delivery approach, will be defined and managed as a business change approach.*

**Benefits Management at the Portfolio Level and Programme and Project Level .**

**Large capital programmes are often called capital projects, we have herein referred to it as a programme, to distinguish it clearly from its component projects. Success at a project level** tends to be about very specific outputs. But until cyclists are able to start using it, no benefits will be realised. Benefits management ensures the project level outputs are delivered (including outputs like delivery of the infrastructure, updated operational regimes, engagement with the community, communications for the launch etc.) and that in collection they add up to the benefit claimed in the programme business case for the investment required, this is demonstrated by table 1 below:

Table 1: The benefits picture at different programme levels

| **Level**                              | **The benefit value chain** | **The dis-benefit value chain** | **Attribute**                                  | **Key management focus** |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Portfolio             | Expected rate of return     | Portfolio risk                  | Correlations and dependencies between projects | Portfolio optimisation   |
| Programme             | Benefit                     | Dis-benefit                     | Outcomes                                       | Programme benefits       |
| Project  | Scope                       | Risk                            | Outputs                                        | Project delivery         |

**Benefits activities at the portfolio level** is focused on understanding the achievement of Owner’s overall strategic goals across the portfolio of programmes and projects for the River Crossing. The involves understanding how the benefit profiles aggregate (and occasionally conflict) across all schemes to permit the achievement of goals, such as reduced delays, passenger journey times etc. Trade-offs are made on an informed basis on whether to prioritise one programme over another based on contribution to strategic goals. With respect to the scheme considered here it is vital to understand the priority of the programmes within the portfolio and any dependencies that must be maintained to or from other programmes within the Owner portfolio.

Dependencies in this case will be important to support benefit delivery across both Owner’s portfolio , and the wider portfolio of Developments with its partners; there are also typically certain data sets that many programme business cases depend upon such as patronage data and travel demand forecasting. **Patronage data** will be sought from adjacent programmes. Centrally updated **travel demand forecasting will be checked to ensure the business cases are valid.** It is judged that Public **communication strategies** do not need to be formally consistent across the portfolio, but there will be linkages between stakeholder and communication strategies.

Benefits Realisation Plan detailing how benefits will be delivered 3. Assurance plan – how will the delivery of the scheme and its planned benefits be reviewed and assured to safeguard the investment, 4. Communications Plan – how stakeholders and stakeholder groups will be engaged***

***2) Benefits Management Plan:***

***The Benefit Management Plan is critical:***

  - ***Overall Approach***

  - ***Benefit identification***

  - ***Benefits analysis***

  - ***Benefits planning***

  - ***Benefit realisation and reporting***

***3. What steps would you follow to assess both benefits and the overall business case following any changes to scope driven from a dependency with another project?***


***We understand that for this scheme there is significant risk of dependencies shifting and potential scope changes arising. The Project is only one project amongst the many projects and programmes comprising the regeneration of this area, and that there will be numerous dependencies on other projects. Relevant projects will be other Owner surface transport projects and projects from other developers.***

***The steps to take would be:***

1.  ***Understand the change to scope driven by the dependency with this other project.***

***This will involve close working with the other project to get the required detail on the changes that have taken place***

2.  ***Understand the benefits placed at risk due to the change in scope.***

***Since the We advocated method of options definition and associated benefits cases have been closely coupled with requirements and scope definition, changes arising from the dependencies will track through into the options analysis in a relatively clear and rapid manner.***

3.  ***Perform an options analysis looking at whether it is attractive to proceed as-is, to invest further to recover the scope changes or whether the scheme is has simply become unviable***

4.  ***Gain stakeholder agreement on the most attractive option and process with the implementation of the updated approach following any required procedures if changes have to take place.***

>***Change Management of the Back Office Organisational Development Programme  
1\. Your Overall Approach  
We understand the challenge of sensitively making efficiency savings from back office functions that have to support front-line operations facing increasing demand. The approach to the engagement is:***

![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image4.png)

***<span class="underline">Programme Management:</span> We will work quickly with the Head of Organisational Development and the existing team to assess the current state of the programme using We’s ‘Programme Diagnostic’ tool to quickly define a suitable programme structure, governance, planning (milestones, dependencies) & controls setup and the programme’s financial security.***


***<span class="underline">Process Improvement:</span> We’s experience suggests that this is best executed when integrated into the change management approach. As part of assessing the impact of change We will work with Owner to set up multi-disciplinary teams that can tap-into existing knowledge of operational processes and set out improvements defined on an informed basis. It is suggested that the multi-disciplinary teams work with stakeholders to appoint change and process improvement leads to champion and embed change.***

***2.Proposed programme structure, high level governance, approach to tracking and reporting  
A scalable programme structure is set out below. Delivery will be supported by an appropriately sized PMO, Change Management and Process Improvement expertise.  
***![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image6.png)***  
The We roles could be staffed by Owner if experienced Owner are available. This structure aims to provide:  
A) Strong, active leadership and sponsorship to drive the change.  
B) Owner projects and enabling work streams supported by Business and Process Change Teams  
C) Business Change Manger to lead the change management team and support project delivery  
D) Process Improvement Manager to lead the process improvement efficiency work stream  
E) PMO Manager with a strong PMO team to pro-actively manage and provide assurance to the programme integrated with the Owner corporate PMO standards. The PMO will manage RAID, finance, planning, controls, resource management, document management, reporting, and benefit management.***

***The governance of such a sensitive change management programme needs to focus appropriately on: Organisation Design, Skills and Experience, Process and Technology, Change Management and HR. We proposes a relatively standard governance model that focuses on the above aspects taking each business area in turn through the phases of: a) impact assessment, b) organisational & process re-design, c) organisational, process and role change, d) business readiness assessment, and e) operate***

![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image7.png)

***The governance model, aligned to Owner’s Governance Framework within Pathway comprises of:  
A. Programme Board that steers the direction of the programme, tracks and reports the performance of the programme, handles large-scale change control and ensures the delivery of the business case***

***B. Advisory Boards where projects seek decision-making and guidance from stakeholders. Expected Boards to support this programme are: Owner Leadership Team, Finance & Policy Committee, HR and Unions.***

***C. Cross Cutting Steering Groups aimed at the People/HR, Process and Technology changes across the portfolio of projects that inform changes at individual business areas and maintain best practices  
D. Project Boards responsible for governing, tracking and reporting performance, local change control, executing plans and ensuring the readiness of updated operating models for particular back office area***

***9. Proposed approach to process improvement  
We has delivered significant process improvements across the Rail sector over a number of years for clients such as Owner, Thales, Invensys Rail, Network Rail and wider. We offers a range of process improvement tools and techniques that can be tailored for Owner. Our approach is:  
• Phase 1 Initiation: develop the map of business areas/processes affected, and engagement plan  
• Phase 2 Current State: conduct As-Is interviews including stakeholders, process & RACI mapping  
• Phase 3 Breakpoint Highlighting: set out & prioritise process breakpoints and develop recommendations  
• Phase 4 Future State: conduct To-Be interviews, develop To-Be process, resource requirements and RACI  
• Phase 5 Implementation Planning: plan to implement agreed To-Be processes matched to resources  
• Phase 6 Execution: execute the plans to realise the To-Be processes together with delivery assurance***

***Q2.*** **Your proposed approach to ensuring integration of controls functions**

***It is proposed that the integration of the tools and techniques used in a project’s implementation is achieved through putting in place the right standards and supporting their adoption through training, review and action on non-compliance***

***This approach aimed to enable integration across: a) the projects within this programme, b) the lifecycle of the programme, c) the parties involved in the programme (suppliers, Owner etc.) and d) the wider portfolio of Owner programmes.***

***<span class="underline">Putting in Place Appropriate Standards</span>***

***This is achieved via a) looking at the existing set of tools and techniques used across the programme, set of stakeholders and suppliers together with Owner standards and We toolsets, b) analysing what is required with respect to this particular scheme c) filling any gaps and gaining agreement across the involved parties (suppliers, Owner etc.) to a set of standards.***

***<span class="underline">Communicating and Supporting Adoption</span>***

***To foster usage and compliance it is suggested that a) commitment to adoption is gained in the setting of the standards, b) communications are issued regularly around expectations well ahead of the expected compliance date and c) support to adoption is put in place. Support can take the form of briefing/training sessions, at-elbow support for key parties, train the trainer sessions to disseminate skills and informal clinics within the central PMO where users can come with questions.***

***<span class="underline">Assuring Adoption</span>***

***An assurance plan will be developed by the PMO that details an appropriate frequency of review together with reporting on key metrics (e.g. usage of standard tools). These adoption reviews could take place in alignment with major gateways on projects within the programme and budget or other resources held back should non-compliance take place.***

***Q3.*** **Proposed method of integrated programme planning**

***Integrated programme planning is achieved through defining the following elements and then ensuring they are effectively implemented through good communications and support:***

***<span class="underline">Master Work Breakdown Structure:</span>***

***This is the master structure for all work in the programme. It effectively sets out where each piece of work sits in terms of hierarchy and is the backbone of a single aligned understanding of the scope of the programme across all dimensions of integration (supplier-stakeholder / lifecycle)***

***<span class="underline">Planning Standards:</span>***

***Setting planning standards (covering aspects like tool-usage, milestone level definitions, earned value criteria, project lifecycle, expectations for interfaces etc.) ensures that all parties develop plans that are consistent and have the ability to integrate and be understood at all levels from suppliers through to senior programme stakeholders. It is critical that these standards set out the expectations for planning information to be sent across interfaces of suppliers to senior stakeholders. This will include the defined plan hierarchy and ownership across the supply-chain/stakeholders.***

***<span class="underline">Plan Baseline and Change Control:</span>***

***Obtain a plan baseline to which all parties can commit. Have a change control process to ensure that the baseline is appropriately defended and a configuration managed set of plans exists.***

***<span class="underline">Plan Reporting Process:</span>***

***To get an integrated view of plan status at an agreed frequency the parties involved (suppliers, Owner etc.) need to provide plan updates in a consistent manner according to a process and schedule that permits review at each level of roll-up of the plans.***

 **Proposed method of interface management**


1)  ***Interface Definition – at regular points along the definition of the programme and its projects, reviews take place of scope breakdown and schedules to understand and register critical interfaces together with handover and safety requirements. Reviews look at particular assets and geographic aspects of the scheme to understand how Owner and suppliers will integrate their deliverables into developed scheme assets. This is a process of elaboration that drills down to lower levels of scope/time/geography as the scheme moves through detailed design. Agreement is required within this definition on the scope/timing/geography from both sides of the interface.***

2)  ***Interface Management – a process is defined that sets out how registered interfaces will be tracked and monitored against changes in scope and schedule amongst suppliers. This process will also take into account the lead times for track possessions etc. so these can be planned in for the interface works to be executed and be completed.***

3)  ***Interface Governance – A forum is set up with a terms of reference to regularly meet to review interfaces and provide actionable outputs to maintain the efficient delivery of the scheme. Outputs will include actions to undertake change control and resolution activity for any interface conflict. Escalation routes are defined to ensure that senior parties within stakeholders are engaged within timescales that provide enough time to react.***

***Q5. Key Sub contract requirements around planning and controls to enable full end to end integration***

***The following sub-contract requirements are suggested:***

1)  ***Planning Standards & Controls: compliance with planning standards and standard controls. Provision of cost loaded plans at agreed intervals.***

2)  ***Scope and Time Requirements: cascaded scope and time requirements developed from the master work breakdown structure defining what is to be done together with integration points e.g. on-time delivery of major milestones.***

3)  ***Baseline and Change Control: compliance and operation of baseline and change control processes in accordance with planning standards.***

4)  ***Reporting: compliance with the reporting process and that reporting data will be sent at agreed frequencies together with specifications for reporting data (tool-usage, planning standards adoption for plan data, accordance with reporting formats etc.).***

5)  ***Configuration Management: compliance with the configuration management standards and processes to ensure one set of configuration master data.***

6)  ***Interface Process: compliance with the interface process, taking part in governance forums and delivery of key milestones representing critical interfaces.***

7)  ***Planning and Controls Assurance: compliance with planning and controls assurance tasks such as audits and reviews at project gateways to assure effective delivery.***

8)  ***Recovery Timescales: Timescales to put right any non-compliance and when arbitration takes place.***

***Proposed method of performance measurement and forecasting***

***<span class="underline">1. Agree the KPI Framework:</span>***

***This aspect of the approach analyses the set of objectives and goals of each stakeholder group and defines and agrees KPIs to capture a measurable and objective metric to demonstrate progress towards them. This is then organised into the hierarchy of KPIs moving from client KPIs to second and third tier KPIs below them all the way through the supply chain. The KPIs will include leading indicators. Ownership and accountability is agreed at this stage.***

***<span class="underline">2. Performance Measurement and Forecasting Process:</span>***

***It is proposed that a performance measurement and forecasting process is set up that utilises the agreed KPIs and gets updated data on them at an appropriate frequency (actual and forecast). This will involve getting regular data from across the supply chain and stakeholders in an agreed format and at agreed lead-times. This is usually via project/programme highlight reports and cross cutting theme reports on programme performance that are reviewed ahead of and in project, programme and theme boards. Off-track actual/forecast data is used to develop corrective actions. It is also proposed that binding agreements are set up via deploying select KPIs into contracts/agreements with suppliers or stakeholders to provide the right levers for action. Earned Value will be tracked each week, and contractor divergences beyond an agreed level will be subject to remedial action. Primavera views will be used wherever possible for preparing reports.***

***Proposed capabilities of planning and controls personnel***

  - ***Sound knowledge of project controls/Owner’s standard controls and the analytical skills to be able to tell when schedules and controls are properly set up, how to help others do this and the ability to spot key findings from schedules and outputs of controls***

  - ***Pro-active nature, diligence and stakeholder management skills to ensure that project controls and planning standards are implemented effectively across suppliers, Owner and wider stakeholders.***

  - ***Ability to write and maintain succinct reports for differing levels relating to the programme – suppliers, internal and external stakeholders***

> ***We will support capabilities by a clear competency process, with coaching where needed.***

***Q8. Proposed key performance indicators for internal reporting***

  - ***Earned Value & Earned Value Predictability***

  - ***Schedule & Cost Performance Index***

  - ***Cost Predictability***

  - ***Anticipated Final Cost & Financial Forecasting accuracy.***

  - ***Cost of Work Done and accruals to date***

  - ***Contingency draw down rate***

  - ***Progress Indicators on Key Milestones (target date, forecast date, date completed)***

  - ***Key Quantity Tracking (e.g. metres of track laid, m<sup>2</sup> of site clearance, site investigations)***

  - ***Interface KPIs (% interfaces concluded to plan, number of interface issues)***

  - ***stakeholder theme KPIs (e.g. sustainability, successful possessions)***

  - ***Change Control KPIs (changes pending approval, number approved, total cost/ time added)***

  - ***Risk & Issue KPIs (total number of risks, issues, P50 and P80 risk analysis detailing exposure)***

  - ***Standards compliance against number of standards applicable***

  - ***The KPIs*** ***below***

***Q9. Proposed key performance indicators for external reporting***

  - ***Budget Position (original budgets, current budget breakdown per major projects within programme)***

  - ***Key Milestone Performance (target date, forecast date, date*** ***completed)***

  - ***Key Stakeholder Theme KPIs (sustainability, community engagement, possession performance (number of possessions, possession overruns, possessions undertaken))***

  - ***Health and Safety (Labour hours without accident, Labour days without incident, RIDDOR.***

  - ***Environmental management (number of environmental incidents (period and rolling))***

  - ***Security (number of security incidents (period and rolling))***

  - ***Major Risks (major programme risks and mitigation strategies)***

# *Proposed planning and controls organisational structure*

![](/images/2020-05-06-Risk-and-benefits-on-construction-projects/image11.png)

***Head of Programme Controls – responsible for setup/operations of the compliant planning and controls methodology and liaison with stakeholders (Owner, the supply-chain). Heads up compliance reviews.***

***Planning Management – function responsible for setting-up integrated planning standards and the planning methodology together with Owner and the supply-chain. Setup/maintain the schema for schedule levels and aggregation: L1(programme), L2(Owner) and L3(suppliers). Supports the joint programme team in the development of a robust overall programme schedule that captures actual performance and accurate forecasting.***

***Cost Management– function responsible for ensuring that costs are applied to the programme in a consistent manner to allow a representative integrated programme baseline to be established. Responsible for cost management standards across Owner and the supply-chain.***

***Change Control & Config. – function responsible for setting up integrated change control across the programme to ensure that unauthorised deviations from the baseline are anticipated and avoided. Operates programme change board, sets standards for operating change control in line with Owner’s methodologies and ensures that Owner and the supply-chain operate to these standards. Responsible for the setup of configuration management standards and the configuration management baseline.***

***Reporting & Systems –function responsible for setting reporting standards (e.g. data standards, metric standards, reporting calendar etc.), implementing them across Owner and the supply-chain and ensuring they are complied with. This function generates the overall programme reporting for the joint team to provide a holistic programme view across the complex interfaces. Responsible for the integrated systems architecture for systems that capture controls data for the programme.***

***Interface Management – responsible for the setup and operation of an effective methodology, process and schedule for interface management across the complex interfaces in the programme. Ensures that the methods are compliant with Owner methodologies and that they are agreed and implemented with the stakeholders and the supply-chain***

***Risk & Contingency – responsible for setting up and operating risk management for the programme across Owner and the supply-chain. Responsible for a compliant risk management methodology and setting up quantified risk assessments that underpin contingency levels. Responsible for compliant and adopted contingency draw-down methodology approved with required stakeholders.***

***All functions are also responsible for: ensuring the ongoing capability of planning and controls personnel, and maintaining strict confidentiality.***

# *Proposed approach to ensuring integration of controls functions*

***Considering the influence a central planning and controls function can exert across this large-scale multi-interface programme it is proposed that controls integration is best achieved through: i) fit-for-purpose and consistent standards across the programme and ii) supporting their adoption/compliance.***

***This approach aimed to enable integration across: a) projects within this programme, b) the programme lifecycle, c) parties involved in the programme and d) wider portfolio of Owner programmes.***

***<span class="underline">Appropriate Standards/Process</span>***

***This is achieved via a) looking at the existing set of tools and techniques used across the programme, set of stakeholders and suppliers together with Owner standards and We toolsets, b) analysing what is required with respect to this particular scheme c) filling any gaps and gaining agreement across the involved parties to a set of standards and the process for using and integrating inputs.***

***<span class="underline">Communicating and Supporting Adoption</span>***

***To foster usage and compliance it is suggested that a) commitment to adoption is gained in the setting of the standards, b) communications are issued regularly around expectations well ahead of the expected compliance date and c) support to adoption is put in place. Support can take the form of briefing/training sessions, at-elbow support for key parties, ‘train the trainer’ sessions to disseminate skills and informal clinics with the planning and controls function where users can come with questions.***

***It is also suggested that adoption is assured via review according to an agreed assurance plan that details an appropriate frequency of review together with key metrics to be reviewed (e.g. usage of standard tools and the frequency of updating data). These adoption reviews could take place in alignment with major gateways on projects and resources held back on non-compliance.***

***.***

# *Proposed method of integrated Programme planning*

***Integrated programme planning is achieved through defining the following elements and ensuring they are implemented through good communications and support:***

***<span class="underline">Planning Architecture</span>***

***Put in place a master work breakdown structure for all work in the programme that defines the modular segments of work being delivered by each stakeholder (Owner, supply-chain). Set out the architectural schema for the ownership and aggregation of plans: planning and controls function responsible for the L1 programme schedule, stakeholders responsible for L2 project schedules and sub-contractors responsible for L3 schedules. This architecture will define the principles of integration across all dimensions – (programme lifecycle, within Owner’s wider portfolio and through the supplier-stakeholder tiering).***

***<span class="underline">Planning Development and Execution Standards/Process:</span>***

***Set out how all parties should develop and monitor of plans to support integration and the provision of a holistic programme view. Plan development guidance includes elements like: how to breakdown work, systematic scope definition, setting task logic, building task duration based on cost and resource loading and critical-path-analysis.***

***To enable performance management and forecasting a consistent method of maintaining an integrated programme baseline is set out together with the integration points and method/process for aggregating reporting on the baseline across the set of involved parties. To anticipate deviations from baseline and avoid them a best-practice change control process is set out and agreed with all -parties.***

***<span class="underline">Compliance Support:</span>***

***It is also critical to know that all-parties are adopting these good-practices. Together with training, coaching and communications on the expectations of the best-practice processes, a transparent review plan is suggested where parties involved in the programme will be assessed on their compliance with supportive corrective actions as needed.***

# *Proposed method of interface management*
