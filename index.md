# Purpose
This site is all about managing project portfolios more easily. 

I provide open frameworks and tool-sets to set up and deliver projects, programmes and portfolios. 

As well as conventional project management, this site introduces specific ways to use machine-learning, natural language understanding and graph databases to deliver better projects. 

Each project and portfolio delivered teaches new lessons which I build into the frameworks. 

# Structure of site

The site is split into a number of code and documentation repositories:

* **A repository for choosing and developing your own [portfolio framework](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks),** which sets out how the portfolio's projects will be set up and delivered

* **A repository for applying [machine learning](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios) to project success prediction** 

* **Several repositories showing how to construct a data model for your projects** These repositories use freely available graph-database technology to manage project data in a way that emphasises the particular structure of your industry, and that emphasises the relationship and dependencies between projects. This can be applied at several levels:

1. [portfolio level](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-models-for-portfolios)
2. [programme level](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-models-for-programmes)
3. [project level](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-models-for-projects)

# The motivation for the site

Other project and portfolio managers can use tools and frameworks that have worked well for me. The generosity of Open Source practice has helped me to learn and work better, and to continually improve on these frameworks. I also learn from the ways that others apply and extend things that have worked for me. 

Finally, it should go without saying, but project management is still more of an art than a science. It is more about people and teams than charts and KPIs. More about consensus, stories, incentives and unintended consequences than top-down planning and flowcharts. Tools and frameworks only do so much. 

It is my experience that by building and re-building useful frameworks, the mechanics of projects take a little less time, and so time and attention is freed up on a project. 

This time can be used for the real work of understanding the company, the context of the portfolio, and finding the unique approach, or having the right conversation, that gives the current portfolio a chance to succeed.
