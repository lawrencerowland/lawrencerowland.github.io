# Strategy mapping for projects

![](/images/Interactive_project_graph_1.png)

This graph has been visualised with a Javascript library. It had originally been created in Gephi. It is an example of how design thinking can help you come up with the right type of strategy solution once you have identified the problems you want to solve.
