# Why?

# An excuse for this whole exercise...

# 4 common problems with project portfolios.

Sudden project failures, unacknowledged business dependencies, cumbersome project-management frameworks and botched set-up: 

1. Projects fail slowly then fast. 

1. Dependencies on the business and between projects are after-thoughts. 

1. Companies mandate fixed and bulky project-management frameworks and life-cycles. 

1. Setting-up the portfolio is botched. Portfolio management never catches up with the latest project changes. 

# How

This library of tools is intended to address each of these. 

1. Projects fail slowly then fast. 

- **Machine learning allows project success prediction and anomaly detection**

1. Dependencies on the business and between projects are after-thoughts. 

- **Tracking the portfolio in a graph database like @neo4j brings relationships into the foreground**

1. Companies mandate fixed and bulky project-management frameworks and life-cycles.

- **Build a smaller, relevant portfolio framework by selecting some service modules, and tuning them to the business domain by text-mining project documents** 

1. Setting-up the portfolio is botched. Portfolio management never catches up with the latest project changes. 

- **Deploy portfolios in GitHub to re-use your best working-practice before whilst tracking every change you need to make.**

# Getting started

- Fix the worst problem, not all of them. 

- A portfolio team can fix it themselves. 

- There are so many Open Source project-management tools that have matured. 

- There's no need for an all-in, end-to-end integrated system until the team knows exactly what it needs.

- Deploying your own portfolio is the best way of getting to know the projects inside-out.
